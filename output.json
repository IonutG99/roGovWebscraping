        "text": "\nPRESS RELEASE\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu had consultations today with representatives of the European Youth Forum and the Youth Council of Romania, part of the Government\u2019s constant institutional dialogue with representative associations of the social and associative sectors.\n\u201cIt is extremely important to have permanent consultations with young people to bridge\u00a0the gap between generations and particularly between the young generation and stakeholders. Young people have the ability to adapt and rapidly accumulate knowledge\u00a0and information, and to come up with innovative solutions. I noticed how internship programs conducted at the level of Government and Parliament brought\u00a0real benefits not only to young people but also to public institutions. For these reasons, it is particularly useful to have a dynamic process of consultations with representative associations of the young generation\u201d, stated Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.\n\u201cWe need vision, commitment, and responsibility on the part of young people, and the fact that we are here together provides us all with a new perspective on the future. Youth\u2019s problems are not few but with the support of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu and the Romanian Government, many of them will find a resolution. The new education law comes in support of youth people to create as many opportunities as possible and to strengthen the relationship between the two generations. Together, we will contribute to the growth of the new leaders both at national and European levels\u201d, stated Minister of Family, Youth and Equal Opportunities, Natalia Intotero.\nThe representatives of the European Youth Forum welcomed the good practices existing at the level of the Government, regarding the Official Internship Program, which provides 150 seats\u00a0this year. Interns enrolled in this program receive, according to Law 176/2018 on internships, a monthly allowance representing at least 50% of the minimum gross salary per economy.\nAlso, the representatives of the European Youth Forum showed that there is a need to enhance\u00a0consultations between youth organizations and public authorities, considering that the topic of youth requires an integrated approach at the level of the Government and ministries.\nAttending the discussions, representatives of the Youth Council of Romania appreciated the completion of the National Youth Strategy by the Ministry of Family, Youth, and Equal Opportunities and emphasized the importance of inter-ministerial collaboration to attain the objectives contained in this document.\nAttending the meeting at Victoria Palace alongside Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, were the Minister of Family, Youth and Equal Opportunities, Natalia Intotero, the Head of the Prime Minister's Chancellery, Mihai Ghigiu, and the representatives of the Chancellery - Secretary of State Mihai Constantin, State Advisers Ruxandra Ivan and Victoria Stoiciu.\n"

This represents a new signal regarding the strong bipartisan support that the security of the Black Sea, as a region of strategic importance for the Euro-Atlantic community, enjoys at the level of the US Congress, alongside the other important decisions which shape a strategic framework for approaching the Black Sea region by the US Administration, including following dialogue and close consultation with Romania.\nIn this context, the two officials also reaffirmed their support for the security and stability of the Republic of Moldova, as an essential part of the security of the Black Sea region.\nPrime Minister Marcel Ciolacu reaffirmed Romania's decision to support Ukraine for the continuation of grain exports to global markets, following the unilateral decision of the Russian Federation not to extend the Black Sea Grain Initiative and presented the complex measures implemented by the Government to improve cross-border connectivity with Ukraine, which contributed to the increase of transit capacities at the border points.\nFor the Romanian side, the use and development of already existing transit capacities and the engagement of support, including financial, from the United States of America and the European Commission for projects aimed at increasing storage and export capacities through the ports of Galati and Constanta remain a priority.\nThe meeting provided a good opportunity to review economic cooperation, as well as the growing bilateral trade, as well as American investments in Romania.\nThe joint efforts regarding the progress in terms of the inclusion of Romania in the Visa Waiver Program were also highlighted and appreciated.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

        "text": "\nPRESS RELEASE\n\u00a0\nPrime Minister Marcel Ciolacu met today, at Victoria Palace, with the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Romania, H.E. Peer Gebauer, a meeting in line with the steps of intensifying highest\u2013level bilateral dialogue that has taken place throughout 2023.\nThe topics addressed during the official visit of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu to Berlin, in early July, were deepened in today's talks. The common goal is boosting economic cooperation in green energy, critical infrastructure, digitalization, research, and innovation sector.\nIn this context, the Head of the Romanian Executive welcomed the organization of the Romanian-German Business Forum due to take place in late September, in Berlin.\n\"Hopefully, by organizing this event, we will strengthen the upward trend of cooperation between our countries and attract new German investments in Romania in key sectors\", stated Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, mentioning, at the same time, the Romanian Government\u2019s openness to encourage the entrepreneurial sector, and also foreign investments.\nPrime Minister Marcel Ciolacu\u2019s meeting with the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Romania, H.E. Peer Gebauer, at Victoria Palace, also occasioned a discussion on bilateral security cooperation at the Black Sea, in the context of Russian aggression against Ukraine.\nIn this respect, H.E. Peer Gebauer thanked Romania for the important role our country plays in this difficult security context and also for the cooperation within the Security Corridors, which ensure the transit of Ukrainian grain, essential for food security at the global level.\nIn his turn, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu thanked Germany for the important support it expressed in favor of Romania's accession to the Schengen Area. \"We continue to rely on this support\", stated the Romanian Prime Minister.\n"

        "text": "\n[Check against delivery]\n\u00a0\nMarcel Ciolacu: Ten days after the entry into force of the Ordinance on cutting back the food prices, everybody sees there is a significant drop in prices at certain food compared to last week.\nFurthermore, we can all notice that food prices have not increased. The ordinance attains its purpose. I would like to congratulate Agriculture Minister Florin Barbu for his perseverance. He worked hard for us to adopt this essential measure and now, Minister goes daily to the supermarkets to see the prices. I think that every Minister and dignitary should do the same in the food stores across the country.\nInstead of inventions like shortages, bankruptcy, and others, today, reality shows that there are 30-40% lower prices for certain basic products. Moreover, there is single-digit inflation. This is the truth.\nI notice that also today, minister of Transport Sorin Grindeanu has new draft government decisions aimed at creating a working point for infrastructure sites. It is about an expropriation corridor for Moldova's motorway on the Ploiesti - Buzau segment, plus another corridor for continuing works on the connecting roads at the suspension bridge over the Danube from Braila.\nWe also have investment objectives for the railway.\u00a0 Mr. Grindeanu inspected the railway building sites yesterday, warning that in some places the works are going too slowly. I think Romanians legitimately expect a more sustained pace and it is natural for people to expect\u00a0to travel by train, in a civilized manner, as in any European country.\nI want Romanians to travel safely not just by train, but also by car, as we are in the vacation period. And Mr. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs, C\u0103t\u0103lin Predoiu, proposes a very important project, called HeliPol. We want to increase the degree of safety on the roads, through an integrated concept, made especially with European money. It is the first time that this approach exists in Romania. The Romanian Police will increase the monitoring and management of road traffic, using new satellite communication equipment and other technologies. Unfortunately, Romania still ranks, first, in Europe in terms of the\u00a0number of road accident fatalities, and therefore,\u00a0I consider this a vital project.\nWe are already preparing for the provision of energy in the cold season and today we have a draft emergency ordinance, through which we ensure the settlement of some payments for energy suppliers. We want the system to continue to be fully functional as it was last winter, with capped prices. I fail, however, to realize how it is possible, under these conditions, that, in the capital of Romania, the mayor Nicu\u0219or Dan continues to force, this year too, hundreds of thousands of inhabitants to wash\u00a0with cold water for whole months. I find it inhuman\u00a0and degrading. And this, three years after the mayor promised the hot water \u201crevolution\u201d. Thank you!\n"
